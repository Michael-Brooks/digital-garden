# Welcome to my digital garden
This is my personal open-source digital garden using Obsidian to create my files and folders. I got the inspiration from Tom Critchlow on "[Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)". The inspiration to use Obsidian mostly came from George Silverman's "[The MindSkills Playbook](https://publish.obsidian.md/mindskills-playbook/_MindSkills+Playbook/Welcome+to+the+MindSkills+Playbook)".

I'm hopeful this will translate quite well with GitHub since Obsidian uses standard Markdown for it's formatting.

- Maybe we can create a server site generator in the future to work with Obsidian based repositories.
